OOPS : object oriented programing system

  oops stand in below pillers

  1) class
  2) object
  3) inheritance
  4) encapsulation
  5) polymorphishism
  6) abstraction
  7) aggregation


----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) class : class is a user defined data type 

      which is contain similar and dis- similar data elements.

      class which is represent by class keyword.

      syntax:

      class <classname>:
             data members
             member functions


2) object : object is an instance or variable of class

       using of object we can access properties oof class.
       object is a blueprint of class.

       one class can have multiple objects.

---------------------------------------------------------

3) inheritance : when one class derived properties of another class its called inheritance.

              it provide reusability

              using of inheritance we can reduce our code

              inheritance mainly use for save development time and maintaince time updation.

there are mainly 5 type of inheritance:

1) single inheritance
2) multi-Level inheritance
3) multi-ple inheritance
4) Hierarchical inheritance
5) hybrid inheritance

1) single level :

                  parent class (super class) (Base class)

                    |
                    v
                  child class (Sub class) (derived class) 

2) multi-level :

                  A
                  |
                  v
                  B
                  |
                  v
                  C

3) multiple :

                  A        B
                  |        |
                  ----------
                      C

4) Hierarchical :

                      A
                      ^
                      |
                --------------
                |            |
                B            C

5) hybrid inheritance :

                        A
                        |
                        v
                ------------------
                |                |
                B                C
                |
                v
          --------------
          |            |
          v            v
          D            E              

-------------------------------------------------------
4) encapsulation : it is behave like an capsule

                  which contain different data members in an single entity
                  its called encapsulation

                  encapsulation prevents data from outside the user

                  which is provide getter and better.
