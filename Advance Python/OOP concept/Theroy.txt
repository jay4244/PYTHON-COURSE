OOPS : object oriented programing system

  oops stand in below pillers

  1) class
  2) object
  3) inheritance
  4) encapsulation
  5) polymorphishism
  6) abstraction
  7) aggregation


----------------------------------------------------------------------

1) class : class is a user defined data type 

      which is contain similar and dis- similar data elements.

      class which is represent by class keyword.

      syntax:

      class <classname>:
             data members
             member functions


2) object : object is an instance or variable of class

       using of object we can access properties oof class.
       object is a blueprint of class.

       one class can have multiple objects.

---------------------------------------------------------

3) inheritance : when one class derived properties of another class its called inheritance.

              it provide reusability

              using of inheritance we can reduce our code

              inheritance mainly use for save development time and maintaince time updation.

there are mainly 5 type of inheritance:

1) single inheritance
2) multi-Level inheritance
3) multi-ple inheritance
4) Hierarchical inheritance
5) hybrid inheritance

1) single level :

                  parent class (super class) (Base class)

                    |
                    v
                  child class (Sub class) (derived class) 

2) multi-level :

                  A
                  |
                  v
                  B
                  |
                  v
                  C

3) multiple :

                  A        B
                  |        |
                  ----------
                      C

4) Hierarchical :

                      A
                      ^
                      |
                --------------
                |            |
                B            C

5) hybrid inheritance :

                        A
                        |
                        v
                ------------------
                |                |
                B                C
                |
                v
          --------------
          |            |
          v            v
          D            E              

-------------------------------------------------------
4) encapsulation : it is behave like an capsule

                  which contain different data members in an single entity
                  its called encapsulation

                  encapsulation prevents data from outside the user

                  which is provide getter and better.

------------------------------------------------------
polymorphishism : poly means more and phishism means forms.

          one named method has different froms its called polymorphishism.

          there are 2 types of polymorphishism

          1)method overloding
          2)method overriding

-> method overloding :
                      when one contain same name method its called method overloding
                      in python method overloding does not support.


-> method ovveriding : 
                      when parsent class and child class both have same method its called
                      method ovveriding.

----------------------------------------------------
abstraction : which is provide only few information not allocated background information.

             using of abstraction we can represent only inital information.
             abstraction which is contain only finiction declartion.

abstraction class : a class which is contain one or many method without functionalitiy
                    or bolck of code.

abstract method : which is contain only declartionnot body part.

ABC : abstract class

-------------------------------------------------
aggregation : 
              inheritance provide us IS-A relationship

              aggregation provide us HAS-A relationship

              aggregation there is no blood relationship or in simple language we can say that
              one class object can use in another class its called aggregation.

------------------------------------------------
3rd part module :::

          like numpy and pandas

pandas : pandas basically use for staticatical purpose and for data anlaysis purpose.
